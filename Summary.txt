Observation and Insight:
From the plot we can see that the time and memory costs are very similiar for small problem. 
It is reasonable because the majority of time and memory cost are caused by the system operations, 
when problem is small both methods do not cost much compared to the system operations.
As the problem goes large, it is obvious that the basic method costs more memory but less time and the efficient method costs
more time and less space. Because in theory, the basic method cost O(mn) space and the efficient method cost O(m+n) space,
when problem gets larger, the difference in memory comsumption is larger. And when the program runs, basic method runs in an iterative way while
the efficient method makes a lot of recursion calls. So that the time consumption is larger for the efficient method.
